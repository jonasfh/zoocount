Zoocount project
==============================

The purpose of the ZooCount programme is simply an easy interface to to count zooplankton when you are working with a stereomicroscope with identifying zooplankton or phytoplankton. Instead of writing a line for each species / stage you observe, you simply assign the species/stage to a key on the computer, and click the key once to increase the count for this species / stage. 

Installation instructions: 
--------------------------

The programme is dependent on Java 1.8 or later. There is a good chance this is already installed on your computer, but if not, it can be found here:
